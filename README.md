## Image Classification on Fashion-MNIST
### Objective: 
To classify images of different pieces of clothing.

### Client & Data-Set: 
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples 
and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
#### Labels:
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

• 0 - T-shirt/top • 1 - Trouser • 2 - Pullover • 3 - Dress • 4 - Coat • 5 - Sandal • 6 - Shirt • 7 - Sneaker • 8 - Bag • 9 - Ankle boot

##### Data-set is publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/ and https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist repository on Github.
### Business Impact:
E-commerce companies have lots of items for sale online which requires lots of images to be displayed on their websites, 
applications and on social media. And it takes lot of human power and time to separate these images into respective groups.
This classifier which we are going to build helps businesses to categorize images into respective groups.

### Methodology:
For this project we will be going to use deep learning concepts like artificial neural networks(ANN) and convolutional neural 
networks(CNN) to build an image classification model which will learn to distinguish 10 different item images into their respective categories.

### Tools & Skills: 
Python - Keras, Tensorflow, Convolutional Neural Networks.
